# Audio_Content_Analyzer
"The 'Audio Content Analyzer' project, implemented in Jupyter Lab using Python, centers on analyzing audio data sourced from the YouTube video 'How_would_I_learn_to_code,' utilizing the services of AssemblyAI for transcription. The project aims to extract insights from the audio content. Key components include preprocessing the audio, analyzing its features, and presenting the findings through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard enables users to explore various aspects of the audio, such as spectrograms or sentiment analysis results, within the Jupyter Lab environment, facilitating intuitive interpretation and exploration of the audio analysis outcomes."
